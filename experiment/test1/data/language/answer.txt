some of these mysteries may be close to being solved the smaller planets of the inner solar system are believed to have formed from matter able to withstand the suns tremendous heat such as rock and metal conversely the gas giants jupiter and saturn are thought to have formed in regions farther from the sun beyond what is referred to as the frost line as temperatures at this distance are low enough for the matter that makes up gas giants to solidify scientists however have observed jupiter­like gas planets in distant solar systems nicknamed hot jupiters orbiting their suns at surprisingly close distances to explain this scientists proposed the concept of planetary migration and a scenario named the grand tack was modeled using jupiters formation as a basis to test the concept in the scenario jupiter takes shape beyond the frost line as is expected but migrates toward the inner solar system imitating hot jupiters however as a result of gravitational forces from our solar systems other gas giant saturn jupiter is drawn back out to its current location farther from the sun despite sounding far­fetched the scenario has been praised for plausibly explaining why hot jupiters exist the grand tack scenario may also provide clarity for other apparent inconsistencies in our solar system when the computer simulations based on the nebular hypothesis projected that mars should be much larger than it currently is the proposed grand tack migration of jupiter suggested an explanation by factoring in jupiters trajectory in the grand tack scenario scientists realized the gas giant was likely scattering matter close to the sun that would otherwise have greatly increased marss mass
